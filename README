Xiangqi-lisp
By Sean Yeh

A simple CLI xiangqi (Chinese chess) game for player vs. player.

I originally intended to write this as a fun way to review lisp the day
before an AI quiz at school; I wrote the bulk of this that day, and later went
back to make it prettier and more user-friendly (relatively!).

An important note: Because this was written primarily for myself, I went with
the move notation system that seemed most intuitive for me rather than the
standard one(s).
    old-position new-position (e.g. h2e2 for the common cannon opening)
I may or may not look into the standard notation(s) in the future.
